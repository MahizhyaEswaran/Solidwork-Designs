# Solidwork-Designs
This SolidWorks design was created for my practice in machine design. It includes accurately modeled parts and assemblies with proper constraints and realistic dimensions. The project helped me improve my skills in mechanical modeling, assembly, and design visualization. All related part and assembly files are included.
